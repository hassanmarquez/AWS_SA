- A region is a cluster of data centers
- Most AWS services are region-scoped
  
  ***Factors that impact region selection***

    - ap-southeast-2a
    - ap-southeast-2b
    - ap-southeast-2c

- Each availability zone (AZ) is one or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking and connectivity.

- They are separate from each other, so they are isolated from disasters.

- They are connected with high bandwidth, ultra-low latency networking.

### AWS Data Centers
### AWS Edge Locations/Points of presence
